# Screen Size Calculator

## A simple calculator of working out screen dimensions based of gathered info

This python application asks for a screen resolution or aspect ratio (1920x1080, 16:10), and determines the physical length and height of a screen panel based of its diagonal size (32", 85", etc).

Nothing too special
